DOING
------
- on branch serialize-fs
  - testing the serialization / deserialization

NEXT
-----
- on branch serialize-fs
  - set the new fs only after deserialization is complete. Attention: some methods relies on current fs and root,
    make them static?
  - serializers: check for duplicate name
  - ConsoleGame.initUserGameState rename to init and pass the home folder. It returns Option[IOError]. It must be called
    with current user as guest, no need for changing the owner
  - ConsoleGame.createUserCommands returns a seq of tuple (commandName, command) (or an Either of)
  - create addMessage command and use it in SellCommand to add messages
  - delete all GameState stuff

DONE
-----
- on branch serialize-fs
  - now serialization / deserialization of whole fs (excluding commands) seems to work
  - serialize/deserialize the folders
  - create a new filesystem and restore folders and files, excluding commands
  - serialization of files and restoration of the file's content on the already existent files
