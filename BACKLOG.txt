DOING
------
- use VirtualFileWithContent.getOrCreate only when needed: mandatory files should be created on new game with a
  fixed content then use the constructor
- trying to recreate the fs from the serialized one retaining passwd and all the folders
- test ConsoleGame

NEXT
-----
- remove Ctr-C handling in MessagesCommand and move it to VirtualProcess
- it's more an issue in vfs: a file with no read permission is still visible! Look at message command and main loop command
- let passwd a data class with a serializer in order to serialize and deserialize it?
- can I move SerializedFS and SerializedFSOperations in scalajs-vfs?
- make static fun to get Market from home
- serializers: check for duplicate name
- make ConsoleGame.createUserCommands returns a seq of tuple (commandName, command) (or an Either of)
  first of all there is not a createUserCommands function in ConsoleGame then why? I cannot remember it,
  the command has a name so?
